# Overview
The aim of this project is to examine the potential to improve the management of roadworks by Local Highway Authorities (LHAs) by analysing the delivery and impact of historical works on UK streets. Through evaluation of past data, the project aims to identify the impact that enhanced planning, coordination, and targeted restrictions could have in terms of reduced delays and disruptions.
