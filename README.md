# Overview
The aim of this project is to examine the potential to improve the management of roadworks by Local Highway Authorities (LHAs) by analysing the delivery and impact of historical works on UK streets. Through evaluation of past data, the project aims to identify the impact that enhanced planning, coordination, and targeted restrictions could have in terms of reduced delays and disruptions.
The project will require machine learning to analyse patterns in the planning and delivery of roadworks.  Specifically, the models will classify the type of works, typical duration of works and traffic manage management type adopted.  The analysis will identify failings in working practices such as works overruns or incorrect rehabilitation of the highway flagged in post-work inspections. 
Predictive models will be developed to establish the scale of potential benefits in better management through the application of differing conditions applied to works.  

# Model development
Some of the key areas of  model development will include Text classification, regression analysis and outlier detection.
